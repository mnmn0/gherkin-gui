# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Spring BootテストGUIソフトウェアは、開発者がGUI上でテスト仕様を記述し、JUnitコードの自動生成、テスト実行、結果閲覧を一貫して行えるElectronベースのデスクトップアプリケーションです。Gherkin形式でのテスト仕様管理により、BDD（Behavior Driven Development）アプローチを支援し、テスト開発の効率化を図ります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and edit test specifications in a GUI interface, so that I can write tests in a user-friendly environment without manually editing files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a main interface with options to create, edit, and manage test specifications
2. WHEN the user creates a new test specification THEN the system SHALL provide a form-based editor for writing Gherkin scenarios
3. WHEN the user edits an existing specification THEN the system SHALL load the content into the editor and allow modifications
4. WHEN the user saves a specification THEN the system SHALL store it in the .gherkin/spec/ directory with proper file naming

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage test specifications in .gherkin/spec/ directory, so that I can organize and version control my test files systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates a test specification THEN the system SHALL save it as a .feature file in .gherkin/spec/ directory
2. WHEN the user lists test specifications THEN the system SHALL scan .gherkin/spec/ directory and display all available .feature files
3. WHEN the user deletes a specification THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding file from .gherkin/spec/ directory
4. IF .gherkin/spec/ directory does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate JUnit test code from Gherkin specifications, so that I can automatically create executable test classes without manual coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a Gherkin specification THEN the system SHALL provide an option to generate JUnit code
2. WHEN the user triggers code generation THEN the system SHALL parse the Gherkin file and create corresponding JUnit test methods
3. WHEN generating JUnit code THEN the system SHALL create proper test class structure with @Test annotations and step implementations
4. WHEN code generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated code and allow the user to save it to a specified location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute JUnit tests from the GUI, so that I can run tests without switching to command line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects generated JUnit code THEN the system SHALL provide an option to execute the tests
2. WHEN the user triggers test execution THEN the system SHALL run the JUnit tests using the appropriate test runner
3. WHEN tests are running THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and real-time status updates
4. WHEN test execution completes THEN the system SHALL capture and store results in .gherkin/report/ directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage test execution results in .gherkin/report/ directory, so that I can maintain a history of test runs and analyze trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL save results in .gherkin/report/ directory with timestamp-based naming
2. WHEN the user requests test history THEN the system SHALL scan .gherkin/report/ directory and list all available reports
3. WHEN storing test results THEN the system SHALL include test status, execution time, error messages, and stack traces
4. IF .gherkin/report/ directory does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view and analyze test results in the GUI, so that I can quickly understand test outcomes and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a test report THEN the system SHALL display detailed results including passed, failed, and skipped tests
2. WHEN viewing test results THEN the system SHALL show execution time, error messages, and stack traces for failed tests
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and sorting options by test status, execution time, or test name
4. WHEN the user clicks on a failed test THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information and suggest potential fixes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to integrate seamlessly with Spring Boot projects, so that I can test Spring Boot applications effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating JUnit code THEN the system SHALL include appropriate Spring Boot test annotations (@SpringBootTest, @AutoConfigureTestDatabase, etc.)
2. WHEN executing tests THEN the system SHALL support Spring Boot test context loading and dependency injection
3. WHEN the user configures a project THEN the system SHALL allow specification of Spring Boot application properties and profiles
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support Spring Boot test slices (@WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest, etc.)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure test execution settings, so that I can customize the testing environment according to my project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure Java classpath, test runner, and Spring Boot profiles
2. WHEN the user sets up a project THEN the system SHALL allow specification of Maven/Gradle build file locations
3. WHEN configuring test execution THEN the system SHALL support custom JVM arguments and environment variables
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL persist configuration for future test runs

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Japanese developer, I want the entire user interface to be displayed in Japanese, so that I can use the application in my native language without language barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display all UI elements, menus, buttons, and labels in Japanese
2. WHEN the user navigates through different sections THEN the system SHALL show all navigation items, headings, and descriptions in Japanese
3. WHEN error messages or notifications are displayed THEN the system SHALL present them in Japanese with clear and understandable text
4. WHEN the user interacts with forms and dialogs THEN the system SHALL show all field labels, placeholders, and validation messages in Japanese
5. WHEN displaying test results and reports THEN the system SHALL use Japanese labels for status indicators, column headers, and summary information
