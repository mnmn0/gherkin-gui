# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the TypeScript linting errors that are preventing the project from passing `npm run lint`. The errors span across multiple areas including React Router DOM compatibility, missing API service methods, incomplete type definitions, and configuration type mismatches. The goal is to systematically resolve all 89 TypeScript errors to restore the project's type safety and linting compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React Router DOM types to be compatible with the current version, so that I can use routing functionality without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project uses React Router DOM THEN the type definitions SHALL be compatible with the installed version
2. WHEN importing routing components THEN TypeScript SHALL not report missing export errors
3. WHEN using routing hooks and components THEN the types SHALL match the available API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API service methods to be implemented, so that the UI components can successfully call backend functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SettingsPage calls getProjectConfig THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method
2. WHEN SettingsPage calls getGlobalConfig THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method  
3. WHEN SettingsPage calls getGenerationTemplates THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method
4. WHEN SettingsPage calls getConfigurationPresets THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method
5. WHEN SettingsPage calls createConfigurationPreset THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method
6. WHEN SettingsPage calls deleteConfigurationPreset THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method
7. WHEN SettingsPage calls saveGlobalConfig THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method
8. WHEN SettingsPage calls saveGenerationTemplates THEN ApiService SHALL provide this method

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete TestReport type definitions, so that report components can access all necessary properties without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing TestReport properties THEN startTime, endTime, environment, reportName SHALL be available
2. WHEN accessing TestReport.summary THEN executionTime, passedTests, failedTests, skippedTests, successRate, recentFailures SHALL be available
3. WHEN accessing TestReport.testSuites THEN it SHALL be properly typed as an array
4. WHEN accessing TestResult properties THEN testName, errorMessage, stackTrace, assertions SHALL be available
5. WHEN importing TestSuite type THEN it SHALL be exported from the types module

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type configuration for GlobalConfig, so that settings components can work with optional properties correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GlobalConfig has optional editor properties THEN TypeScript SHALL accept partial configurations
2. WHEN GlobalConfig has optional ui properties THEN TypeScript SHALL accept partial configurations
3. WHEN removing IPC event listeners THEN the channel parameter SHALL be properly typed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors resolved, so that the linting process passes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run lint THEN zero TypeScript errors SHALL be reported
2. WHEN building the project THEN TypeScript compilation SHALL succeed
3. WHEN importing any component or service THEN all type dependencies SHALL be satisfied
